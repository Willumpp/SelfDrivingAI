# SelfDrivingAI
A comparison of different algorithms for driving simulated vehicles on a test track.

## Purpose
This project was to demonsrate a comparison of diffent algorithms and gather data on their performance into a SQLite database\
The algorithms used were:\

- Reinforcement Learning (Machine learning)
- A* pathfinding
- Heuristic algorithm based on distance to track
